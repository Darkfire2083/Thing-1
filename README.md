TSB Saitama script that just changes your animations. You gain NO advantages from using this. Things that are changed with this script are:

- Normal Punch animation
- Shove animation
- Uppercut animation
- Uppercut velocity removed
- Death counter animation and sounds are changed

I MAY add more stuff in the future if I can think of stuff to change. This is a passion project to help me learn roblox scripting for funsies :)
